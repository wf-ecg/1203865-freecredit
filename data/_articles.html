            <h2> Credit history — your financial magic 8-ball</h2>
            <p> You may start receiving credit card offers when you’re at college.
                These years can be a good time to practice responsible credit
                habits and establish your credit history with a card like
                the <a target="_blank" href="http://adfarm.mediaplex.com/ad/ck/6214-181812-3408-24"> <em> Wells&nbsp;Fargo Cash Back</em><sup>SM</sup> college card</a><sup>1</sup>.</p>
            <hr>
            <p> Apply for a credit card in your name, and use it sensibly to make purchases and fund emergencies.
                As your purchase activity and payment information is reported to the major credit reporting agencies,
                you’ll start building a solid credit history.
                Think of this predictor as your financial magic 8-ball, only much more reliable.</p>
            <h4> Credit basics</h4>
            <p> Using a credit card means you’re borrowing money that you agree to repay within a certain timeframe.
                There is a cost to using a credit card called interest, and it’s calculated as a percentage of your balance.
                There are also fees to consider.
                You’re responsible for repaying what you borrow plus any fees and the added interest.
                Unlike a debit or prepaid card, when you responsibly use a credit card in your name, you build a credit history.
                Credit payment information is reported to major credit bureaus as you make purchases.
                Missing payments may hurt your credit score.
                You improve your credit score by staying within your credit limit and paying on time each month.</p>
            <h4> Credit history is important</h4>
            <p> You may want to live off campus sometime while in college, get an apartment, or buy a car someday.
                Before landlords rent to you, they may ask to view your credit report.
                So can utility companies, lenders, and others.
                Having good credit gives you added flexibility, more choices,
                and helps you qualify for better loan rates as you reach these milestones.</p>
            <h4> How to establish good credit</h4>
            <p> Fortunately, a roll of the magic 8-ball has nothing to do with establishing good credit, but how you use credit does.
                Therefore, use credit responsibly, pay your bills on time,
                and follow these rules to help you stay on track:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> Borrow only what you can repay.</li>
                <li> Know your credit limit and stay within it.</li>
                <li> Make at least the minimum payment due on time every time.</li>
                <li> Pay off your debt as promised.</li>
                <li> Avoid cash advances except in an emergency.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Over time, you will establish a credit history that will demonstrate you know how to use credit and are a creditworthy adult.</p>

                    Cardholders will earn a one percent (1%) cash reward for every $1 spent in net purchases (purchases minus returns/credits) made on the Credit Card account, rounded to the nearest one cent.
                    During the first six billing periods from the date the account is opened, for purchases made at retailers whose merchant code for Visa is classified in one of the following categories: grocery stores, drugstores, and gas stations,
                    Cardholders will earn an additional two percent (2%) cash reward for every $1 spent in net purchases made on the Credit Card account, rounded to the nearest one cent.
                    These additional rebates earned during the first six billing periods at the select merchants will appear on the Cardholder’s account statement 1–2 billing periods from the date earned.
                    Purchases not processed using these merchant codes for Visa will not qualify for bonus cash rewards.
                    Wells&nbsp;Fargo does not have the ability to control how a retailer chooses to classify their business and therefore reserves the right to determine which purchases qualify for bonus cash rewards.
                    Certain purchases/transaction do not earn cash rewards.
                    The following purchases/transactions do not earn cash rewards: cash advances of any kind, balance transfers, SUPERCHECKS™,
                    casino gaming chips, wire transfers, off-track wagers, lottery tickets, or bets or wagers transmitted over the Internet.
